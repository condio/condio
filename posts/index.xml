      <description>Growing Up When I was young, my father would drive me around town in his white 1988 Trans Am GTA. It was loud, the exhaust smelled funny, and it was fast. To me as a passenger, that car was the coolest thing ever. Thirty-two years later, the car is still running fine and my dad still drives it in the summer. That cars not going anywhere.
I was also fortunate to live in a neighborhood with a few good cars growing up.</description>

      <description>How did you spend your time in quarantine? While stuck inside, I tried to think of ways to be productive. I originally thought about learning to juggle, but I decided instead to learn about static site builders.
